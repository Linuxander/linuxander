### NTFY Server Deployment on AWS using Terraform
Resources:
- [Repo: ntfy_aws_deployment_iac](https://github.com/Linuxander/ntfy_aws_deployment_iac)

Some AWS builds take a while to deploy.  Baby-sitting the command terminal and waiting for it to complete can be dreading.  We can easily get distracted and check too soon or late, wasting valuable time.  I came across a neat server called NTFY, which can notify you on your phone and smartwatch when commands are complete.  The setup requires manual intervention to install and configure.  To simplify this process, I created a Terraform project that deploys this NTFY server for you and outputs the public IP address required to complete the setup on your phone.
