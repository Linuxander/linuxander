### Hi, I'm Alexander!

I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer with 17 years of experience in software development and automating code integration & deployments. Companies hired me to bring complex projects to life and improve existing ones. Last year, I made the exciting decision to prioritize my professional growth by leaving my corporate role and immersing myself with the cloud technologies I enjoy.

- üëî I am on a mission to find a job opportunity with a company that values experience, continuous learning, and dedication.
- üöÄ Every day I am refining my technical skills in either Web Development, RESTful API, CI/CD, or Infrastructure-as-Code.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently expanding my understanding and experience with microservices.
- üå•Ô∏è Development on the AWS Cloud Platform is what I have been focusing on lately.

# Cloud Engineering

## Terraform: NTFY AWS Deployment IaC

Deploying cloud resources that take a while to build and you want to get notified on your smart watch or phone when your terraform/commands complete (or fail)?  Then use this Terraform repository to deploy a NTFY server on the AWS Cloud Platform.  It creates an NTFY server on an Amazon EC2 instance and provides you with the IP address so you can finalize the NTFY app setup on your phone. When you're done and no longer need this setup, simply run `terraform destroy` so you don't get charged while you're not developing.

## Terraform : AWS EKS Cluster

This repository deploys a full Amazon VPC networking setup, with an AWS EC2 Jenkins server, and an EKS Cluster.  The intention is to automate a full configuration for an entire CI/CD system geared for a Kubernetes project.

This repository deploys several terraform modules that completes a serverless application on the AWS Cloud Platform.  The modules include networking (VPC, Subnets, Route Tables), RDS databse, Lambda functions (Python), Lambda layers, API Gateway, and Cognito.

# Configuration Management

## Ansible: Computer Application Management

This is an Ansible repostiory that allows you to specify desired applications to have installed on debian-based Linux systems.  I use this to manage family and friends computers and to also configure newly provisioned Linux systems to my liking in an automated way.
